# What is this?
This is a repo containing each of my attempts at solving the days for Advent Of Code 2024.
All problems are solved with Bash/Shell scripts. I picked this language so I can improve my skills
at Linux command line tools, like awk, sed, xargs, grep, and so on. And because I want a good
challenge. >:3
